# AWS Lightsail

This config sets up a Lightsail instance and points a Route 53 (sub)domain to it.

Effectively, it gives you a VM and a domain for it, with the least amount of configuration.

Note that some manual effort is still required:

- Setting up SSH keys beforehand
- Opening up the HTTPS port

You'll also want to customize the size of the insstance.

See the files for more details.
